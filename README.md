# Hello, I'm Erdit ðŸ‘‹

I work with a team of great-minded developers at [Script-Ware Software](https://github.com/ScriptWare-Software). I am also currently studying Computer Science at degree level.

Most new projects I contribute to are likely to be on our organisation GitHub account. Feel free to check those out (and maybe you can contribute too?).

I love C/C++, Python and more recently Rust!
